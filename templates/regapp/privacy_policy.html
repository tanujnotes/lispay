                                <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
                                <p>This is information that you provide to us through text fields, such as your name,
                                    payment information, social media links etc. The information we collect is different

                                    creator, or become a creator by creating your own Lisplay page.</p>

                                <h5>All Accounts</h5>
                                <p>To create an account on Lisplay you have to provide your:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Email address</li>
                                    <li>Username</li>
                                    <li>Password</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>You also have the option to add more information to your profile, such as a location,
                                    social media links, profile picture and an about section, which we store along with
                                    any comments or messages you submit through Lisplay.</p>

                                <h5>Subscribers</h5>
                                <p>A subscriber is someone who financially supports creators through Lisplay. To become
                                    a subscriber you have to provide one of our payment processor (Razorpay) with
                                    your payment information. You can see the privacy policy for Razorpay on their
                                    website. They provide us with a token that represents your account, your cardâ€™s
                                    expiration date, card type and the last four digits of your credit card. If you
                                    provide them your name, email address and mobile number then they also provide us
                                    that information.</p>
                                <p>We collect and process information about the creators you support, the level at which
                                    you support them, what rewards you receive and how often you support them.
                                    As a subscriber, if you become eligible for a physical reward, then you have
                                    to provide your shipping information so the creator can ship you the reward.</p>

                                <h5>Creators</h5>
                                <p>A creator is someone who creates a Lisplay page requesting financial support from
                                    subscribers. To become a creator, you must create a page that describes what you are
                                    creating any rewards you are offering. We collect and process this information along
                                    with any additional information you add to your profile. To receive payments you
                                    have to provide us your bank details. You must also provide us with additional
                                    information for tax purposes. Depending on your location you have to fill out a form
                                    with some combination of your:</p>

                                <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
                                <p>We collect information automatically as you navigate the site or through our third
                                    party analytics providers. We may store usage information such as the type of device
                                    you use to access Lisplay, your operating system, browser type, IP address, and
                                    device ID, the pages you visit or request, links clicked, referring sites, user
                                    interactions and your search terms. We also derive your location from your IP

                                <h5>Do Not Track</h5>
                                <p>Our service does not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means our
                                    third party analytics providers may associate your usage on Lisplay with your usage
                                    on other sites.</p>

                                <h5>Cookies</h5>

                                    Lisplay. We also use retargeting cookies to present you with Lisplay advertising on
                                    other websites.
                                    We use Google Analytics cookies to see how
                                    you use Lisplay so we can improve in a variety of ways. We encourage you to read the
                                    <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google privacy policy</a>.
                                    If you prefer to not have data reported by Google Analytics, you can install the

                                <p>While we try to keep this list up to date, we often experiment with new third party
                                    analytics providers, and this list may not be exhaustive.</p>
